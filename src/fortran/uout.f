      subroutine uout(v,mi,ithermal)
!
!     This routine allows the user to write user-defined output
!     to file. The output can be brought into the routine by commons
!     (FORTRAN77) or modules (FORTRAN90). The file management must
!     be taken care of by the user.
!
!     INPUT:
! 
!     v                  solution vector
!     mi(1)              max # of integration points per element (max
!                        over all elements)
!     mi(2)              max degree of freedomm per node (max over all
!                        nodes) in fields like v(0:mi(2))...
!     ithermal(1)        applies to the present step
!                        0: no thermal effects are taken into account
!                        1: thermal boundary conditions for mechanical
!                           calculations
!                        2: heat transfer calculation
!                        3: coupled temperature-displacement calculation
!     ithermal(2)        applies to the complete input deck:
!                        0: no thermal effects are taken into account
!                        1: only mechanical steps
!                        2: only heat transfer steps
!                        3: at least one mechanical and one heat transfer
!                           step, or at least one coupled temperature-
!                           displacement step
!
!     OUTPUT: none
!           
      implicit none

      integer mi(*),ithermal(*)
